        <p><h4>Description</h4></p>
        <p>This pizza dough is super simple, and toppings of your choice means
            that everyone is happy!</p>
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg white bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2x 7 dried yeast sachets</li>
            <li>1 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Tomato puree/passata</li>
            <li>Pizza toppings of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Method</h4></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Sieve the flour and salt onto a clean surface and make 
                a well in the middle.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and oil into 650 ml of lukewarm
                water, and then pour into the well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Uisng a fork, bring the flour into the liquid gradually. When it
                starts to come together use your hands to knead the mixture into a dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the dough in a bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave for an hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the dough and knead it slightly to remove the air. Divide up into balls
                according to the number of pizzas that you're making - this dough should
                make 6-8.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the pizzas out around 15 minutes before you're goin to cook them.
                Cover with the tomato puree or passata, and toppings of your choice,
                we recommend a healthy layer of grated cheddar cheese on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pop the pizzas on a baking tray and into a preheated oven at around 180
                degrees for ten minutes. Leave to cool slightly and enjoy!
